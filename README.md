### Problem statement: Need to predict the housing price with different ML algorthms to see which suits better to solve the problem

### About the dataset:
Getting the Data- Using kaggle for getiing the dataset
This dataset was derived from the actual data on the housing market.
The dataset has multiple different input variables that are interesting to explore. 
The size is such that it is well suited for interesting visualisations and and explorations.

### AIM : The aim of our analysis is to- 
âœ” Understand which features are important in determining the price, and
âœ” Form a strategy for processing our data before feeding them to a Machine Learning algorithm.

### Libraries:
Pandas for handling and analysing data, and
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

1. Performed exploratory data analysis(EDA) for better understanding of the data as this is one of the most important steps in any Machine Learning process
2. Performed Feature selection to consider the important columns
